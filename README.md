Black Alder is a modern, reliable private platform designed like the black alder tree. It anchors deep (roots), coordinates growth (trunk & branches), and provides clear oversight (canopy). Built for multi-domain, multi-region cell architectures‚Äîmanageable "from the roots up."

## üå≥ The Black Alder Analogy

Like the black alder tree, this platform is designed for:
- **Deep Anchoring**: Purpose cells interface with infrastructure, drawing just what they need
- **Coordinated Growth**: Domain cells divide risk and coordinate growth within the grove  
- **Clear Oversight**: Canopy layer governs policy and provides visibility across the platform
- **Symbiotic Partnership**: Works seamlessly with external services like Corrective Drift optimization

### üçÉ Layer-by-Layer Architecture

#### Canopy ‚Üí Management Plane (Top Layer)
- **Role**: Global policy, tenancy, catalogs, APIs, SSO/RBAC, audit
- **Analogy**: The canopy "sees" the forest, regulates light and growth; sets the micro-climate for everything below
- **Talk Track**: "One place to observe, decide, and direct"

#### Trunk & Major Branches ‚Üí Domain Cell Layer (Middle)
- **Role**: Regional/cell orchestration, routing, failover domains, data locality, service mesh boundaries
- **Analogy**: The trunk carries instructions and nutrients; branches segment growth into strong sections
- **Talk Track**: "Segment by domain, standardize by design"

#### Roots (Fine & Coarse) ‚Üí Purpose Cell Layer (Bottom)
- **Role**: Specialized workload clusters, pipelines, data services, edge nodes
- **Analogy**: Roots interface with the soil (infrastructure), draw resources, and adapt to conditions
- **Talk Track**: "Thousands of fine interfaces, optimized for the job"

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Terraform** >= 1.0
- **kubectl** >= 1.24
- **Helm** >= 3.0
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster (EKS, GKE, AKS, or bare-metal)
- Cloud provider credentials configured

### Basic Deployment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mlourenp/black-alder-platform.git
cd black-alder-platform

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Basic deployment with default settings
terraform apply

# Access Grafana (if observability enabled)
kubectl port-forward -n black-alder-observability svc/prometheus-grafana 3000:80
```

### Deploy Sample Cells

```bash
# Deploy comprehensive sample cells (all cell types)
./scripts/deploy-sample-cells.sh
```

## üéõÔ∏è Feature Toggle System

Black Alder provides "flip of a switch" observability and feature control:

### Core Features

| Feature | Variable | Default | Description |
|---------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Multi-Cloud Orchestration** | `enable_crossplane` | `true` | Crossplane for unified control plane |
| **Service Mesh** | `enable_service_mesh` | `false` | Istio + Merbridge eBPF acceleration |
| **Observability Stack** | `enable_observability_stack` | `true` | Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager |
| **eBPF Observability** | `enable_ebpf_observability` | `false` | Cilium, Tetragon, Falco |
| **Deep Observability** | `enable_pixie` | `false` | Deep debugging and profiling |
| **Cost Estimation** | `enable_cost_estimation` | `true` | Infracost integration |
| **Cell Deployment** | `enable_cell_deployment` | `true` | Grove-based infrastructure patterns |

## üèóÔ∏è Grove-Based Architecture

Black Alder implements a grove-based architecture with specialized cell types:

### Cell Types in the Grove

| Cell Type | Purpose | Tree Analogy | Scaling |
|-----------|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Channel** | API Gateway, External interfaces | Canopy edge - interfaces with external environment | Horizontal |
| **Logic** | Business logic, Computation | Main branches - core processing | Horizontal |
| **Data** | Storage, Databases | Tap roots - deep, stable storage | Vertical |
| **ML** | Machine Learning, AI workloads | Specialized branches - adaptive growth | GPU-based |
| **Security** | Security scanning, Compliance | Bark - protective boundary layer | Distributed |
| **External** | Third-party integrations | Mycorrhizal network - external partnerships | Connection-based |
| **Integration** | Workflow orchestration | Root network - inter-tree communication | Event-driven |
| **Legacy** | Legacy system integration | Grafted branches - integration with existing systems | Bridge-based |
| **Observability** | Monitoring, Alerting | Sap flow - system health monitoring | Storage-intensive |

### üå± Cross-Cutting Functions as Tree Biology

- **Telemetry** = Sap flow: Continuous metrics/logs/traces move up/down the system
- **Identity & Policy** = Bark: Protects and defines boundaries; renews as the system grows
- **Networking** = Root web & mycorrhiza: Interconnected communication and resource sharing
- **Resilience** = Riparian adaptation: Built for bursty traffic, AZ loss, with fast recovery paths
- **Lifecycle** = Seasonal growth rings: Every release leaves an auditable "ring"

## ü§ù The Optimization Partner

Like black alder's symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria that fix nitrogen, Black Alder works with external optimization services:

- **Black Alder** = Control & reliability
- **Optimizer Service** = Intelligent enrichment  
- **Partnership**: Optimizer enriches the "soil" (resource pool) without changing the tree's identity

## üîß Development & Contributing

### Local Development

```bash
# Set up development environment
./scripts/setup-dev.sh

# Run tests
